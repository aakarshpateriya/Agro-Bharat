That sounds like a fantastic initiative! Creating a platform like Agro Bharat can definitely help farmers by providing them with a convenient way to sell their crops at the right price and rent machinery when needed.

Here are some features you might consider including on your website:

Marketplace for selling crops: A platform where farmers can list their crops for sale, including details such as quantity, quality, and expected price.
Price comparison tool: A tool that allows farmers to compare the prices of their crops across different markets, helping them make informed decisions about where to sell.
Machinery rental: A feature that allows farmers to rent machinery such as tractors, harvesters, and irrigation equipment from other farmers or service providers.
Crop advisory: Providing farmers with information and advice on crop cultivation, including best practices, weather forecasts, and pest management tips.
Community forum: A space where farmers can connect with each other, ask questions, and share their experiences and knowledge.
Mobile app: Consider developing a mobile app to make it easier for farmers to access the platform from their smartphones, especially in rural areas where internet access may be limited.
